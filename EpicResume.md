## About Me
* I am currently a junior at Littleton High School. My favorite subject in school is math and some of my least favorite are LA and History. 
* In my free time I often watch tv shows or play chess. I'm definitely not athletic nor do I do anything that requires a lot of physical activity either.
* It was in my freshman year when my interest in computer science began, I was taking an intro to computer science course (taught in python) and I really
* liked how critically you have to think and problem solve in order to program.

### Strengths
- Perseverance
  * I often try to persevere through problems and obstacles that face me. An example of this is when I got stuck in one of my labs for a while.
* Communication
  * I always try to communicate with my peers the best I can
### Goals
- Understanding recursion and being able to use it efficiently.
- Being able to find a good job in CS in general
- Learning cybersecurity as supplemental knowledge to broaden my CS skills.

## EPIC Experience

### Data Structures
* In this class I learned about the different data structures and how to use them. In the beginning we started out with sorting algorithms such as bubble sort,
* insertion sort, merge sort, and selection sort which are all comparison sorts (with merge sort being the best out of the four I mentioned but requiring 
* knowledge of recursion). Then we moved onto stacks and queues which is a really helpful tool in a lot of scenarios. After that we moved onto linked lists
* which taught us how nodes work and how to use them efficiently. The last couple of labs we did were radix sort, BST (binary search trees), and priority queue.
* These last labs made us use all the tools/knowledge we had in previous labs and apply them to make more complex data structures. 
 
### Workforce Readiness
* Collaboration
    * I was able to collaborate a lot with my peers and classmates. Whether this was asking for help on a project or needing clarification on a concept I was able to talk to my other classmates without hesitation.
* Critical Thinking & Problem Solving
  * I developed a lot of strategies while I was doing the labs in class. Some of these strategies consisted of ways of trying to learn a new concept such as asking a peer or trying to self-teach myself the concept outside of class.

## Projects:
-  Doubly Linked List - *https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/doubly-linked-list-frogfrogfrogfrogfrog*
    - Describe the project and it's purpose
    - Describe what skills you used and what you learned during this project
- Radix Sort - *https://github.com/EPIC-Campus-LPS/radix-sort-frogfrogfrogfrogfrog*
    - The project consisted of me having to code the sorting algorithm radix sort. Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts the elements based on it's least significant digit and then moves to higher significant digits.
    - The skills I learned in this project is understanding the uses of hash tables and how to deal with collisions in one. A hash table is a table that contains all the outcomes of a hash function.
    - A collision is when two things hash to the same index in a hash table and chaining is one of the ways to resolve that.
